Hi all, I'm using this repository to store interesting powershell scripts to keep my emulation software up to date or complete other management tasks. 
Currently focusing on a one-click update solution which can grab the newest download link and overwrite the existing version on the local PC. Note: You will need to tweak the directories depending on your hard drive setup. Everyone's will be a little different.
